# Spotimizefy
**Full &amp; Working Spotify Optimizer for Windows.**

# Download

https://github.com/gzmatte/spotimizefy/releases




# Compatibility
- Windows Defaults Working.
- Windows 10/11 20h2-22h2 Customs working.
- 1809 maybe works.


# Fix
If you can't start Spotify or you have a black image, replace the "NETUTILS.DLL" in Spotify folder with one from google.

In Cmd paste this:
bcdedit /set nx OptIn
sc start null

Maybe it resolves it. Custom isos can not work.

- I do this because Velytics Spotify Optimizer is not working anymore (at least for me).
